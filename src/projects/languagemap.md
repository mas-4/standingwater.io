This project was inspired by a trend on reddit.com/r/languagelearning where
people would post world maps with the countries colored by the languages they
spoke. I decided to build an actual dedicated web app that would automatically
color the countries themselves.

To do this required a lot of data gathering and cleaning. Doing that itself was
an arduous process that had a lot of false starts. The final method I settled on
was to use Google Sheets 'importhtml' function, which could be used to import
Wikipedia tables to a spreadsheet. To automate this I used Python and gspread.

It was definitely a lesson in data gathering and cleaning.
