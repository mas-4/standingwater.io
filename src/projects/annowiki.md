The ICC is a web application designed to allow for collaboratively building an
exhaustive and definitive repository of annotated literature. I designed,
developed, deployed, and continue to maintain the project solo, managing
occasionally to rope in some programmer friends for help with various
features.It consists of ≈14k lines of code and ≈100k lines of code churn. The
backend uses Flask/SQLAlchemy. The frontend uses Jinja2, Sass, and VanillaJS. I
also had to write several ETL data pipelines for process-ing Project Gutenberg
texts. It is deployed via Heroku. I learned the entire web application life
cycle on this project, and it continues to teach me. It is currently maintained
at [https://anno.wiki][0]. I am also currently working on a second iteration of
the site.

- Primarily coded in [Flask][1]/[SQLAlchemy][2]
- Wrote many [ETL data pipeline scripts][3] for processing [Project
  Gutenberg][4] text files into custom JSON formats
- [Heroku][5] for platform
- [MariaDB][6] for database
- [Elasticsearch][7] for search
- Vanilla JavaScript for AJAX and progressive enhancements
- [Talisman][8] for CSRF security
- [pytest][9] for testing
- [WTForms][10] for forms
